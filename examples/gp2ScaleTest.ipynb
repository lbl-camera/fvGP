    "# gp2Scale \n",
    "gp2Scale is a special setting in fvgp that combines non-stationary, compactly-supported kernels, HPC distributed computing, and sparse linear algebra to allow scale-up of exact GPs to millions of data points. Here we run a moderately-sized GP, just because we assume you might run this locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope it is clear how cool it is what is happening here. If you have a dask client that points to a remote cluster with 500 GPUs, you will distribute the covariance matrix computation across those. The full matrix is sparse will be fast to work with in downstream operations. The algorithm only makes use of naturally-occuring sparsity, so the result is exact in contrast to Vecchia or inducing-point methods."
